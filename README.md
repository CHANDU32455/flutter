D.Waste is as an open source AI-powered app that enables users to identify the type of waste they are trying to dispose of and provides guidance on how to do so correctly. The app offers a rewards program to incentivise proper waste management, and users can earn points for correctly identifying and disposing of waste.
The app also provides educational resources on waste management and tracks the user's progress over time. Deep Waste is currently available on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/deep-waste-ai/id6445863514?platform=iphone) the and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hai.deep_waste).

## Background
Waste identification is a crucial step in the waste management process that enables facilities to properly handle, recycle, and reduce their waste, while also ensuring compliance with regulations and tracking their progress over time. The integration of machine learning models with mobile devices can enhance the precision, ease, and effectiveness of waste management endeavors, as well as furnish valuable information for monitoring and decreasing waste.

In this app,  we have prepared a substantial collection of waste images and trained a machine learning model. The trained model is then installed on a mobile device, enabling real-time waste identification. By simply capturing an image of the waste with their mobile device, users can receive an instant classification of the waste into categories such as paper, plastic, glass, metal, and more, via the machine learning model.
With this approach, one can have many advantages such as:
- **Convenience**: By using mobile devices, waste identification can be performed anywhere, at any time, making it more accessible and convenient for users.
- **Increased Accuracy**: Machine learning models are trained on large datasets, which can result in improved accuracy compared to manual waste classification.
- **Real-time Feedback**: By using a mobile device, users receive instant feedback on the type of waste they are dealing with, allowing them to make informed decisions on how to properly manage the waste.
- **Data Collection**: The data collected through mobile waste identification can be used to track waste generation and management efforts over time, helping to identify areas for improvement and set new waste reduction goals.

## How is it used?

After training the AI model, we export it to TensorFlow Lite for mobile device compatibility. Using the app, users take or upload a picture of their waste, which the model then analyzes and provides suggestions for waste management. When users successfully manage their waste, they receive rewards. To enhance the accuracy of the system, users can submit incorrect predictions and specify the type of waste.

## Research papers

Several research papers have been published to support this research. Here are a few of them:

- [Deep Learning in Waste Management: A Brief Survey](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202407.0637/v1)
- [Managing Household Waste Through Transfer Learning](https://tecnoscientifica.com/journal/idwm/article/view/408)
- [MWaste: An app that uses deep learning to manage household waste](https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/ctr.2023008)


## Data sources 

We have created our own waste dataset to support the app which can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumn2u/garbage-classification-v2/). These dataset consists of waste images grouped into 10 classes (**metal**, **glass**, **biological**, **paper**, **battery**, **trash**, **cardboard**, **shoes**, **clothes**, and **plastic**). It is collected from various internet sources and through the app, labeled and manually verified. Data preprocessing activities including data cleaning, resizing, normalization, and file format handling were performed.

## Challenges
This project classifies most of the waste but for some, it's still a problem. These images whose accuracy is less than 45 or with wrong prediction needs to be find into the model so that machine can learn from it. Besides that, some of the devices has problem running the model resulting crashing the whole application.

## REST API?
The REST API of the deep waste model can be found [here](https://github.com/sumn2u/deep-waste-rest-api).

## What next?
The plan is to add a way to support internationlization. The language support will help to reach more people and lessen the boundries.
